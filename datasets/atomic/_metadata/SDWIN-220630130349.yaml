description: |-
  After getting a shell with elevated privileges on the target, we used auditpol.exe to modify the current system audit policy for the Process Creation subcategory of Microsoft Windwos Security Auditing.

  Success and failure events were disabled using the /set command and /success /failure parameters.

  This dataset was generated using a Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation edition (Version:21H1,OS Build:19043.1766) and Kali Linux (Version:2021.3).
